# Image Display Issue - Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The photos/images were not displaying on the portfolio website due to a JavaScript lazy loading implementation issue.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Function Call**: The `initLazyLoading()` function was defined but never called in the main DOMContentLoaded event listener.
2. **Incomplete CSS Class Management**: The lazy loading script was removing the `lazy` class but not adding the required `loaded` class that the CSS expected for showing images.
3. **CSS Opacity Issue**: Images with `loading="lazy"` attribute were set to `opacity: 0` by default and only became visible with the `.loaded` class.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Missing Function Call
**File**: `js/main.js` (lines 3-15)
- Added `initLazyLoading();` to the main DOMContentLoaded event listener

### 2. Fixed Lazy Loading Implementation
**File**: `js/main.js` (lines 305-331)
- Added `img.classList.add('loaded');` to make images visible when they load
- Added fallback for browsers without IntersectionObserver support
- Improved error handling

### 3. Additional Improvements
- Created proper assets directory structure (`assets/images/`)
- Updated assets README with favicon instructions
- Added comprehensive error handling for image loading

## Images Currently Used
All images are loaded from external Unsplash URLs:
- Hero image: `https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507003211169-0a1dd7228f2d?w=400&h=400&fit=crop&crop=face`
- Project images: Various Unsplash URLs for different projects

## Still Needs Attention
1. **Favicon**: The `assets/favicon.ico` file is missing and should be created
2. **Local Images**: Consider downloading and hosting images locally for better performance and reliability

## Testing
The fix has been applied and the images should now display correctly when you:
1. Open the website in a browser
2. Scroll through the different sections
3. Check that both the hero image and project images are visible

## Browser Compatibility
The lazy loading implementation now includes:
- Modern browsers: Uses IntersectionObserver API
- Older browsers: Fallback that loads all images immediately
